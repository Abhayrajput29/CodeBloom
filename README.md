# CodeBloom

**Discover. Discuss. Build upon.**

CodeBloom is a project-centered developer community for discovering software, sharing work in progress, discussing technical decisions, and learning from other implementations.

## Run locally on Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Requirements

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js 20.9 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Install and start

Open Terminal on macOS/Linux or PowerShell on Windows, then run these same commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Abhayrajput29/CodeBloom.git
cd CodeBloom
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm install` installs the locked dependencies and creates `.env.local` from `.env.example` only when `.env.local` does not already exist. It never overwrites an existing local environment file. When the server reports it is ready, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop it.

The first installation requires access to the package registry.

### MongoDB Atlas configuration

Public browsing and the local preview work without database credentials. To use the full authentication and database features, add `MONGODB_URI` and `AUTH_SECRET` to `.env.local`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.qndvdch.mongodb.net/codebloom?retryWrites=true&w=majority
AUTH_SECRET=your-secure-32-byte-secret
```

With MongoDB Atlas configured, user accounts, profiles, projects, votes, bookmarks, comments, and project updates are all stored and queried directly from MongoDB Atlas collections. Passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt and sessions are maintained via secure HTTP-only cookies.

### Public deployment URL and SEO

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in the production environment to the exact HTTPS origin (scheme and host only, for example `https://your-real-domain.example`). This enables absolute canonical and social-preview URLs plus the sitemap. Leave it unset for local development; the app deliberately omits absolute SEO URLs rather than guessing a public domain. Only the substantive homepage and project-exploration page are currently included in the sitemap; application, auth, and client-resolved detail routes are not indexed yet.

## Development commands

Run these from the project directory on any supported platform:

```sh
npm run dev        # start the local development server
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript check
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm test           # unit tests
npm run build      # production build
```

GitHub Actions runs the type-check, lint, unit tests, and production build on Linux, macOS, and Windows for pushes, pull requests, and manual dispatch. It does not deploy the app and does not require secrets. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request.

## Project status

The application includes a public landing and project preview, Supabase email-auth flows, profile APIs and editing, draft-first project publishing, private-bucket screenshot uploads, live project detail data, and owner-authored progress updates. These Phase 4 paths depend on the reviewed migration `20261101120000_project_media_updates.sql`, which is prepared but not yet applied; live Storage/RLS behavior has not yet been verified. Public preview content may be fixture data. Project editing/deletion, the pending social migration, community membership, private chat, notification delivery, GitHub metadata, and deployment remain incomplete or unverified.
